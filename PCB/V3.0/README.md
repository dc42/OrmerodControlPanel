This is the schematic for the version 3.0 standalone PanelDue controller board. The PaneDue 5i with integrated display uses the same circuitry for the part that interfaces to the Duet, with the following changes:
1. A different 3.3V regulator chip is used
2. Connector X4 has a different pinout. Numbering the pins from the left (with the adjacent X4 legend), the pin connections are:
* Pin 1: PB6 (intended for rotary encoder push button)
* Pin 2: PA2 (intended for rotary encoder A pin)
* Pin 3: PA3 (intended for rotary encoder B pin)
* Pin 4: +3.3V
* Pin 5: Ground (rotary encoder common pin)
